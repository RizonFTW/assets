# 4.12.0 (2023-11-24 04:59:30.795551+00:00)

## Added

- Teams now supports vanities like bots and servers do to allow for quicker linking to your team!
- Webhooks: Multiple webhooks (up to 5) can now be created as opposed to just one
- Webhooks: Proper support for event whitelists in webhooks to allow different webhooks to process different events


## Updated

- Fixed a bug in which reviews would constantly reload itself
- HTTP bots will no longer show a status at all in most cases as they aren't connected to the gateway
- Style improvements including larger tab buttons


# 4.11.0 (2023-11-19 09:52:31.892560+00:00)

## Added

- Search has been internally rewritten to support multiple entities such as Servers etc.
- Webhook URL's are now shown/visible in the settings page. Previously, both URL and Secret used to not be viewable once set but now only Secret is invisible
- More improvements to our upcoming server listing platform
- Teams has been more fleshed out (4.12.0 improves this even further) with new options.
- Added 'Simple Auth' to webhooks. This allows developers to use the same typical 'Authorization' header method they've been using on other bot lists instead of dealing with our custom encryption system. This is opt-in and disabled by default.
- URL layout has been revamped with new/better vanity support
- Team 'data holders' have been added due to Data Request handling. A 'data holder' owns the data in a team and all teams must have one. They are also responsible for any leaks of personal data within your team
- User pages have been rewritten to group bots by their teams if possible as well as to show entities such as Bots/Servers/Packs within different tabs to both reduce bandwidth and to allow for scaling to other entity types in the future
- Internal configuration system has been rewritten to improve the Developer Experience (DX) when developing the site


## Updated

- CDN assets such as core icons, team avatars and bot/server/team banners have been moved to our own CDN due to upcoming "CDN authentication" checks coming to the Discord CDN
- In accordance with the CDN changes, ticket attachments have also been moved to the CDN thanks to AES-256-GCM. While the attachments are stored publicly, the decryption key can only be accessed by the author as well as Infinity Bot List staff thus protecting tickets from evil eyes.
- The Premium Page for bots now shows all eligible bots correctly
- Major bug fixes to webhook testing. The page no longer endlessly reloads
- Update fetch calls due to API changes to prepare for our server list
- Improvements to our CI processes and versioning code
- Better management of permissions on the site
- Improvements to data requests and data deletion requests to more comprehensively fetch user data
- Better asset management for images in line with our CDN changes including card previews when setting a new banner/avatar etc.
- Partners/Changelogs/Staff Templates page(s) have been updated to be on our database instead of a static slice in our server and the frontend has been updated to take the necessary API changes into account
- Accessibility improvements including better use of ARIA in inputs including checkboxes and labels, better alt tags for images and in-general improvements throughout the site
- Rewrote the authentication code to take up less bundle size. This also led to several fixed bugs where null'd credentials crashed the site
- Rewrote the 'About Us' section to take server listing into account as a future feature
- General bug fixes and improvements to the site
